# LINKS

*Note that this page isn't complete yet. I will update this page as i progress through
the semester finding new sources for learning. Enjoy and have fun learning!<br> 

- [OSC10 Slides](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/index.html)<br>
I personally think that this website could really help you 
throughout the semester. It's got all the materials concluded in a 
powerpoint form. Plus, OSC10 is frequently referenced.

- [Slides](https://github.com/os2xx/os/tree/master/Slides/)<br>
This page can be found at the LINKS section at the OS website. I included
it here so i can easily find it hehe. This consists of slides from the very 
first till last chapters. If you like to learn in advance, I recommend 
seeing this slides first.

### Week 00<br>

- [OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/)<br>
This comes from our very own favorite website which is geekforgeek. It has
many subsections explaining about Operating System. Reading this page really
peaked my interest, so that's why I'm sharing it with you guys.

- [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)<br>
Coming from Linux's own website, this page contains many knowledge 
knowledge about Linux. I find it quite interesting. It's very 
detailed and if you like to learn new things, you should
visit this link. 

### Week 01<br>

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>
This link is quite good for beginners learning about markdown. It has
a lot of informations in a compact manner. It is more of a cheat sheet
rather than a full on guide. This link even helped me create this very website :).

- [Linux Commands](https://www.loggly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Linux-Cheat-Sheet-Sponsored-By-Loggly.pdf)<br>
This link is a cheat sheet full of linux commands. It has a lot of 
info in a compact manner, which makes it really easy to find useful commands.
So i highly recommend checking this out!

- [Bash](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
As what the title says, this page contains information about Bash.
This link is really great in my opinion. Even though it doesn't get
too in depth, it compiles almost everything you need to know about Bash
in only 1 page.

- [SED](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/) and [AWK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/?ref=lbp)<br>
It is actually two different pages, but it is on the same website 
so that is why I put it together. Both of them talks about sed and AWK.
Yet again it is in a compact form, which i really like. Another upside is
that it provides useful examples so we can comprehend each command better.

- [Regex](https://www.rexegg.com/)<br>
This website is a very thorough explanation about regex. It starts
from the very definition, a cheat sheet, even examples and tips we
can utilize. This website overall has everything you need to know 
about regex.

### Week 02<br>

- [Cyber Security 1](https://accesspointcorp.com/en/blog/cybersecurity-complete-guide/)<br>
This website gives information on cyber security. I think it is quite interesting
because some of the knowledge I get here, i haven't read it at the OSC10 slides. 

- [Cyber Secuirty 2](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security)<br>
I personally think that these website complements each other with the
first Cyber Security website I recommended. This website has detailed info. 
Another thing I like is that the web writes it in points, so it's easy to
grab the information in a quick way.

- [C Language Handout](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-beginners-handbook/)<br>
C language is an intricate language in my opinion. For the people that likes to
learn stuff by reading, this web is the one for you. It discusses a lot from variables
to structures and even about preproccesor. 

- [C Language Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0)<br>
This one is for the people that likes to learn by watching. It's a crash course, because
it's duration is shorter than some C language tutorial. But, I personally think it is a
great starting point for learning C.

### Week 03<br>

- [File System](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br>
It is a website from Guru99. As the name suggests, this web explains a lot about
file systems. Many of it is explained in detail in OSC10, but I think it's written simpler.
Therefore it is enjoyable to read and easy to pick out important informations.

- [File System on Linux](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-file-system)<br>
On the previous link, it discusses about file system in general. While this link
mainly tells about file system specifically on Linux. It is filled with new insights and
knowledges. I highly reccomend this website to quench your curiosity.

- [Linux File Management and Navigation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/basic-linux-navigation-and-file-management)<br>
When doing our tasks, we often deal with commands such as cd or maybe ls. We also always interact 
with directories and ofcourse files. This web will help a lot. It told me numerous new commands
that I could've utilised with my early assignments. I'll definetly be refering to this page a
lot! 

### Week 04<br>

- [Fragmentation](https://www.javatpoint.com/fragmentation-in-operating-system)<br>
Yes I know we learned about Fragmentations last week, but we are still on the topic of Memory
and it showed up again when I was learning for quiz. I couldn't really grasp the concept 
through the slides alone, so I also used this website. It has several new insights, but the
selling point for me is that it could reinterpret what the slides explain but in easier
words.

- [Paging and Swapping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-paging-and-swapping-in-os/)<br>
This page gives a brief overview on Paging and also Swapping. It also gives a comparison between the both, which enhances my understanding on both the topic. For those curious about Paging and/or Swapping, I highly recommend this one.

- [Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0qIYWo8igs)<br>
The Video is made by Portfolio Courses, and is described as a quick 30 minutes overview of Dynamic Memory Allocation in C. Well we're learning about C, and we're also learning about Memory Allocation, so I thought to myself why dont I just learn it both at the same time. So here it is!

### Week 05<br>

- [Virtual Memory](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/virtual-memory#:~:text=Virtual%20memory%20is%20a%20common,(RAM)%20to%20disk%20storage.)<br>
Here is a brief overview on virtual memory. It explains a lot about virtual memory, but not really in depth. It's quite good for getting started or just to know about the basics and fundamentals. 

- [Virtual Memory & Linux](https://tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/vm-intro.html#:~:text=Linux%20supports%20virtual%20memory%2C%20that,be%20used%20for%20another%20purpose.)<br>
This is, in my opinion, more in depth than the previous link I mentioned. It correlates a lot with linux, and essentially everything that we learned this week. It got lots more pages on this web, and it's highly technical. So prepare yourself for some great knowledge :).

- [Lowest Memory](https://superuser.com/questions/973925/why-is-the-recommended-memory-on-a-virtualbox-guest-os-512mb)<br>
This may have little relation with this week's topic, but I personally think it's worth a read. This week's assignment was on how low on memory can we get to boot up the virtual box. It peaked my interest about it, and i went searching and this is the page i got. 

### Week 06<br>

- [Processes](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/3_Processes.html)<br>
I found this web page while searching for study materials for the quiz. Basically it is the same material found on the slides (because it referse to the same book by Silberschatz). But what I like about this page by UIC is that it summarizes a whole lot about processes and some other stuff. It also highlights several key points.

- [Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)<br>
I got tired of reading so I opened youtube for my studying. I visited Neso Academy and chose this video which is an intro to threads. Though it may not be as thorough as reading Silberchatz, or maybe the slides, but it explains threads in a simplistic manner. This video may not be enough for intermediate or advanced learner, but I personally think it's enough to start studying or refresh our minds for this topic.

- [Concurrency](https://www.javatpoint.com/concurrency-in-operating-system)<br>
Another great website for CS is javatpoint.com. Filled with numerous topics, I found them covering about concurrency. Yes it may not be the most perfect or complete, but it has tons of important points that is discussed which in my opinion is the essence for understanding concurrency. 

### Week 07<br>

-[Deadlocks](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/7_Deadlocks.html)<br>
A nice summary of Deadlock from Silberschatz by UIC. The content is similar, just written in a concise yet complete way. It's a long read, but worth your time to study on it.

-[Race Condition](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-race-condition)<br>
This one is a light read. It introduces the reader on race condition both in electronics and operating system. Yes it may be short, but it has more chapters that can help us understand more on this week's topic.
