# LINKS

*Note that this isn't complete yet. I will update this page as i progress through
the semester finding new sources for learning.<br>
*Week 00, 01 

- [OSC10 Slides](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/index.html)<br>
I personally think that this website could really help you 
throughout the semester. It's got all the materials concluded in a 
powerpoint form. Plus, OSC10 is frequently referenced.

- [Slides](https://github.com/os2xx/os/tree/master/Slides/)<br>
This page can be found at the LINKS sectionat the OS website. I included
it here so i can easily find it hehe. This consists of slides from the very 
first till last chapters. If you like to learn in advance, I recommend 
seeing this slides first.

Week 00<br>

- [OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/)<br>
This comes from our very own favorite website which is geekforgeek. It has
many subsections explaining about Operating System. Reading this page really
peaked my interest, so that's why I'm sharing it with you guys.

- [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)<br>
Coming from Linux's own website, this page contains many knowledge 
knowledge about Linux. I find it quite interesting. It's very 
detailed and if you like to learn new things, you should
visit this link. 

Week 01<br>

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>
This link is quite good for beginners learning about markdown. It has
a lot of informations in a compact manner. It is more of a cheat sheet
rather than a full on guide. This link even helped me create this very website :).

- [Linux Commands](https://www.loggly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Linux-Cheat-Sheet-Sponsored-By-Loggly.pdf)<br>
This link is a cheat sheet full of linux commands. It has a lot of 
info in a compact manner, which makes it really easy to find useful commands.
So i highly recommend checking this out!

- [Bash](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
As what the title says, this page contains information about Bash.
This link is really great in my opinion. Even though it doesn't get
too in depth, it compiles almost everything you need to know about Bash
in only 1 page.

- [SED](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/) and [AWK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/?ref=lbp)<br>
It is actually two different pages, but it is on the same website 
so that is why I put it together. Both of them talks about sed and AWK.
Yet again it is in a compact form, which i really like. Another upside is
that it provides useful examples so we can comprehend each command better.

- [Regex](https://www.rexegg.com/)<br>
This website is a very thorough explanation about regex. It starts
from the very definition, a cheat sheet, even examples and tips we
can utilize. This website overall has everything you need to know 
about regex.
